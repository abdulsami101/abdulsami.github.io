I’m a **Machine Learning Researcher** specializing in **image generation** using **diffusion models**, with a strong focus on multilingual font generation, phonetic awareness, and few-shot learning. I’m currently completing my Master’s in Computer Science at Soongsil University, Seoul, under the guidance of [Prof. Jaeyong Choi](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=YJ7fWWgAAAAJ&hl=en). I'm passionate about generative AI, computer vision, and building models that push creative boundaries.
